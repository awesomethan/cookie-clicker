As an introductory web dev project, I made a simulation of the popular game Cookie Clicker! Feel free to try the game at https://awesomethan.github.io/personal-website/#/portfolio. There are definitely many improvements that can be made, so I'll try to make better and more visually pleasing projects in the future!
